I study the genetic factors that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and Alzheimer's disease.  

I develop and apply computational tools to measure gene expression, mRNA splicing, and genetic variation, as well as statistical methods to integrate multiple types of genomic data.
